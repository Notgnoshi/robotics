    "You are given three distance sensors which all measure the same distance. To determine the accuracy of each you run repeated measurements of an object which you setup so that the sensor will return 2 meters. Running 40 measurements you obtain the data listed below. Next you measure the distance of an object ahead of the robot. Sensor $A$ gives 2.4577696, sensor $B$ gives 1.8967743, and sensor $C$ gives 2.1352561. Combine these readings to make a more accurate estimate of the object distance. Hint: you need to figure out the distributions and the data according to the variances.\n",
