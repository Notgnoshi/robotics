Write a two link manipulator location program (Python). This program will take a list of angles and compute the location of the end effector. Show how this program works with the list of angles you generated in the previous problem. If the angle inputs are generated by a square, the simulated robot arm’s end effector should trace a square. Plot the end effector points. You need to plot the input shape and the final shape to see if your code is correct. You will need to use the previous problem for this problem. Demonstrate your code to trace out the four segments which form the square with endpoints $(5,0)$, $(5, 15)$, $(20, 15)$, and $(20,0)$."
